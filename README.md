## An API created in GO to simply learn some concepts

### Stages of the learning development
- [x] Use Go's sql interface with [pgx](https://github.com/jackc/pgx) drivers to integrate with an Postgres database, and [gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) for the api server. _(the first commit is using this)_
- [ ] Change the databse connection and the model resolution to use [gorm](https://gorm.io/)
- [ ] Implement authentication on the api

Both the api an the database will run using Docker.

The goal is to use this repository to keep track of all learned concepts of an API in GO.
